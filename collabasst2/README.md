# Collabasst2
This is the folder for the assignment 2 test, called collabasst2. It test the standard part of CS3231 assignment 2.

### Notes:
* Do not print to the console (ever!) Except:
  1. A test needs to be done by the eye. If so print what it is expected before, doing the test.
  2. An error has occurred. It should exit(1) after the test failed.
  3. ALL test are done. 
* The code contains planning of what to test. Planning was done on the basis of Edwin and Shanush's code. Testcases may not have been covered. So please add more.
* Make sure to delete test.file in your root folder before starting the test
